  m_text: "<mark>CNNnews</mark>\nAs wintry weather whips across the United States,
    one challenge may be staying warm if you can\u2019t afford or are cutting back
    on indoor heating.\r\n\r\nStaying warm is necessary \u201Cfor a variety of health
    reasons\u201D in addition to comfort, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive
    director of the American Public Health Association. For people with arthritis,
    stiffness \u201Cin your back and neck and sore joints do occur more in colder
    weather. \u2026 People who have metabolic conditions can be sensitive to the
    weather, like diabetes, for example, and heart disease. The more cold you are,
    the more stress you put on your heart.\u201D\r\n\r\nA little savvy based on our
    warm-blooded bodies, food, appliances, furniture, the outdoor elements and more
    can go a long way. Here are 25 ways to stay warm this winter \u2014 with or without
    indoor heating \u2014 that won\u2019t break the bank.\r\n\r\nHow to warm your
    body\r\nPortable electric warmers are one way to temporarily keep parts of the
    body warm.\r\nPortable electric warmers are one way to temporarily keep parts
    of the body warm.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nWarm up with store-bought hand warmers,
    microwavable heating pads, hot water bottles or heated blankets. Following the
    manufacturer\u2019s instructions and concentrating on your torso are key, said
    JohnEric Smith, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology at Mississippi
    State University. \u201CIf you warm the core you can warm the hands and feet.
    It is harder to warm the core by warming the hands and feet.\u201D\r\n\r\nBe
    careful that you don\u2019t burn yourself, Benjamin said. \u201CThey\u2019re
    very effective on a knee or shoulder or the back of the neck. \u2026 You rarely
    put it directly on your skin. You usually wrap it in something, maybe a thin
    towel.\u201D\r\n\r\n Move your body. Physical activities like indoor exercise
    or dancing can help you warm up, but don\u2019t get to the point where you\u2019re
    sweating, Smith said. \u201CWe sweat to lose heat and sweating will make us colder.\u201D\r\n\r\nThink
    twice about taking a warm shower or bath. \u201CWhile a warm bath or shower will
    feel good for the minute,\u201D Smith said, \u201Cyou will be cold after you
    get out and your wet skin is losing heat more quickly.\u201D\r\n\r\nCuddle. Snuggles
    really can keep you warm. \u201CEach of us produces heat through our metabolic
    processes. We lose our heat to the environment as we maintain body temperature,\u201D
    Smith said via email. \u201CIncreasing skin contact decreases opportunities for
    the heat to be lost to the environment around us. If two people are under a blanket
    both of their heat losses combined can increase the temperature under the blanket
    more quickly than either could do independently.\u201D\r\n\r\nChange how you
    perceive cold. Some people have trained their minds to perceive cold as an objective,
    acceptable sensation rather than something dreadful to control. The best ways
    to adapt include wearing clothing in layers then removing it, or gradually lowering
    the thermostat and putting on a sweater, Benjamin said.\r\n\r\nWarmth that\u2019s
    comforting\r\nEnjoying warm foods and beverages is a two-in-one solution: You
    get heat from the appliances when you cook the food, then warmth when you eat
    it. \r\nEnjoying warm foods and beverages is a two-in-one solution: You get heat
    from the appliances when you cook the food, then warmth when you eat it.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nEnjoy
    warm beverages and foods, and use the oven and stove to cook them. Since foods
    higher in fat and protein are metabolized slowly by the body, those could make
    you feel warmer, Smith said. \u201CConsider hearty soups with beans and meat.\u201D
    Slow cooking meals can help generate heat throughout the day.\r\n\r\nDrinking
    warm beverages \u201Ccertainly helps take the chill off,\u201D Benjamin said.
    Leaving the oven or stove on is \u201Ca bad idea because it burns fuel,\u201D
    Benjamin said, \u201Cbut more importantly, people fall asleep, they forget and
    leave the stove on. Sometimes things on the stove can catch on fire. So like
    any tool, you should use it for the purpose in which it was designed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    only has to go poorly once to be life changing,\u201D Smith said. If you don\u2019t
    have children or pets, when you\u2019re done cooking and you turn off the oven,
    what doesn\u2019t hurt is leaving the oven door open to let residual heat escape.\r\n\r\nHow
    to dress for the cold\r\nCozying up underneath layers of clothing or blankets
    (or both) can help insulate you from the cold.\r\nCozying up underneath layers
    of clothing or blankets (or both) can help insulate you from the cold.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nLayer
    on the clothes. \u201CLayering is critical,\u201D Smith said. \u201CEven thin
    layers added together to increase one\u2019s ability to retain heat \u2026 focus
    on keeping the torso warm. Often an extra shirt or vest can warm your hands and
    feet more than an extra pair of socks or gloves.\u201D Inexpensive pairs of tights
    or long johns can be worn underneath clothes. However, be sure that layering
    doesn\u2019t make your clothing tight, he added, since that could reduce blood
    flow and thus your body\u2019s ability to get warm blood to those areas. Wearing
    a hat, too, can also keep the heat in.\r\n\r\nWear thick socks and slippers.
    Fuzzy socks, slippers or a pair of shoes you reserve for wearing around the house
    can add extra comfort.\r\n\r\nPile on the blankets. \u201CThe more layers you
    put on, the better it helps trap the air between you,\u201D your sheets and your
    blankets, Benjamin said. Since you lose a lot of heat from your head while you\u2019re
    under blankets, he added, wearing a skull cap can help also.\r\n\r\ntightslead\r\nWinter
    tights that are equal parts stylish and cozy (Courtesy CNN Underscored)\r\nEmbrace
    less breathable clothing and linens. Breathable linens (such as the cotton-based
    variety) are often recommended during the summer, but linens with other materials
    and higher thread counts may be better for winter since higher thread counts
    have more weaving per square inch.\r\n\r\nOptimize your home and appliances\r\nThere
    are multiple ways to make your heating system work better, or to create your
    own warmth. \r\nThere are multiple ways to make your heating system work better,
    or to create your own warmth.\r\nShutterstock\r\nWork with the weather. Open
    your curtains or blinds to let the sun in during the day, or when outside is
    warmer than inside your home.\r\n\r\nSeal your windows and doors. Even if your
    windows and doors are totally shut and locked, drafts can seep in through small
    crevices. You can use caulk or shrink film to seal those cracks. Placing inexpensive,
    transparent shower curtains over windows can keep the sun in but the cold draft
    out. For the bottoms of doors, cloth draft stoppers are \u201Cvery effective,\u201D
    Benjamin said.\r\n\r\nClose off unoccupied rooms. By shutting the doors of rooms
    no one is using, you can create additional barriers between yourself and the
    cold outdoors. This can also aid preventing heat loss from the room you\u2019re
    in.\r\n\r\nReverse your ceiling fan. If possible, send your ceiling fan in a
    clockwise direction so that it sends the warm air down.\r\n\r\nSit near indoor
    heaters. You can safely use portable heaters if they are space heaters that have
    automatic shutoffs and can be plugged into a wall outlet instead of an extension
    cord. Since space heaters are a common cause of fires, they should be at least
    3 feet away from any drapes, bedding or furniture. To prevent high levels of
    carbon monoxide \u2014 which can cause potentially fatal poisoning \u2014 ensure
    you have a carbon monoxide monitor installed and that you don\u2019t \u201Cuse
    any type of outdoor gas heater or anything that is not electric,\u201D Benjamin
    said.\r\n\r\nMove anything that\u2019s blocking heat vents or radiators. The
    heat will better circulate throughout your home that way.\r\n\r\nSpend time and
    sleep in the upper levels of the house. Heat rises, so moving your working, sleeping
    and living spaces upward may be more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAfter showering, don\u2019t
    run the bathroom fan or close the door. Unless your bathroom is prone to growing
    humidity-induced mold, the warm steam from the shower can make the nearby air
    less dry and cool for a short period of time.\r\n\r\nBuy magnetic vent covers
    from home improvement stores. Used to cover vents, they can be inexpensive and
    help to force heat to exit vents in the occupied rooms only.\r\n\r\nPut down
    rugs or carpets. These can be warmer to the touch than bare floors.\r\n\r\n Insulate
    your attic. If you can afford to, padding your attic with insulation from hardware
    stores can help to retain some of the heat you usually lose through the attic
    since heat rises.\r\n\r\n Research what your residential area offers. Some locations
    may be running warming centers set up for safety during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nCozy
    up near the elements\r\nSitting near a fire is a method that's always reliable.
    \r\nSitting near a fire is a method that's always reliable.\r\nShutterstock\r\n
    Light a fire. If your fireplace runs on wood instead of gas, a fire is another
    way to keep a room warm and enjoy a cozy night. \u201CMake sure that your flue
    is properly opened and clean to make sure that smoke doesn\u2019t come back in
    the home but goes properly up the flue,\u201D Benjamin said. \u201CWhen the fire
    is out, you should of course close the flue because it\u2019s like having an
    open window.\u201D\r\n\r\n Keep warm and enjoy s\u2019mores. If your state, city,
    county or neighborhood allows, have a (moderate-size) backyard bonfire to keep
    warm for a while.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t light candles. Candles can emit a small amount
    of heat, but using them as a source of warmth can be dangerous. \u201CPeople
    will light candles and go to sleep, and they fall over,\u201D Benjamin said.
    \u201CThe cat comes in and kicks it over and starts a fire.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith
    these tips in mind and any others you find, be \u201Cbroadly thoughtful about
    how to stay warm in the winter,\u201D he added. \u201CIf it sounds like it\u2019s
    a bad idea, it probably is. Look it up and check it out before you do it.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis

  content: "<mark>CNNnews</mark>\nAs wintry weather whips across the United States,
    one challenge may be staying warm if you can\u2019t afford or are cutting back
    on indoor heating.\r\n\r\nStaying warm is necessary \u201Cfor a variety of health
    reasons\u201D in addition to comfort, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive
    director of the American Public Health Association. For people with arthritis,
    stiffness \u201Cin your back and neck and sore joints do occur more in colder
    weather. \u2026 People who have metabolic conditions can be sensitive to the
    weather, like diabetes, for example, and heart disease. The more cold you are,
    the more stress you put on your heart.\u201D\r\n\r\nA little savvy based on our
    warm-blooded bodies, food, appliances, furniture, the outdoor elements and more
    can go a long way. Here are 25 ways to stay warm this winter \u2014 with or without
    indoor heating \u2014 that won\u2019t break the bank.\r\n\r\nHow to warm your
    body\r\nPortable electric warmers are one way to temporarily keep parts of the
    body warm.\r\nPortable electric warmers are one way to temporarily keep parts
    of the body warm.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nWarm up with store-bought hand warmers,
    microwavable heating pads, hot water bottles or heated blankets. Following the
    manufacturer\u2019s instructions and concentrating on your torso are key, said
    JohnEric Smith, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology at Mississippi
    State University. \u201CIf you warm the core you can warm the hands and feet.
    It is harder to warm the core by warming the hands and feet.\u201D\r\n\r\nBe
    careful that you don\u2019t burn yourself, Benjamin said. \u201CThey\u2019re
    very effective on a knee or shoulder or the back of the neck. \u2026 You rarely
    put it directly on your skin. You usually wrap it in something, maybe a thin
    towel.\u201D\r\n\r\n Move your body. Physical activities like indoor exercise
    or dancing can help you warm up, but don\u2019t get to the point where you\u2019re
    sweating, Smith said. \u201CWe sweat to lose heat and sweating will make us colder.\u201D\r\n\r\nThink
    twice about taking a warm shower or bath. \u201CWhile a warm bath or shower will
    feel good for the minute,\u201D Smith said, \u201Cyou will be cold after you
    get out and your wet skin is losing heat more quickly.\u201D\r\n\r\nCuddle. Snuggles
    really can keep you warm. \u201CEach of us produces heat through our metabolic
    processes. We lose our heat to the environment as we maintain body temperature,\u201D
    Smith said via email. \u201CIncreasing skin contact decreases opportunities for
    the heat to be lost to the environment around us. If two people are under a blanket
    both of their heat losses combined can increase the temperature under the blanket
    more quickly than either could do independently.\u201D\r\n\r\nChange how you
    perceive cold. Some people have trained their minds to perceive cold as an objective,
    acceptable sensation rather than something dreadful to control. The best ways
    to adapt include wearing clothing in layers then removing it, or gradually lowering
    the thermostat and putting on a sweater, Benjamin said.\r\n\r\nWarmth that\u2019s
    comforting\r\nEnjoying warm foods and beverages is a two-in-one solution: You
    get heat from the appliances when you cook the food, then warmth when you eat
    it. \r\nEnjoying warm foods and beverages is a two-in-one solution: You get heat
    from the appliances when you cook the food, then warmth when you eat it.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nEnjoy
    warm beverages and foods, and use the oven and stove to cook them. Since foods
    higher in fat and protein are metabolized slowly by the body, those could make
    you feel warmer, Smith said. \u201CConsider hearty soups with beans and meat.\u201D
    Slow cooking meals can help generate heat throughout the day.\r\n\r\nDrinking
    warm beverages \u201Ccertainly helps take the chill off,\u201D Benjamin said.
    Leaving the oven or stove on is \u201Ca bad idea because it burns fuel,\u201D
    Benjamin said, \u201Cbut more importantly, people fall asleep, they forget and
    leave the stove on. Sometimes things on the stove can catch on fire. So like
    any tool, you should use it for the purpose in which it was designed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    only has to go poorly once to be life changing,\u201D Smith said. If you don\u2019t
    have children or pets, when you\u2019re done cooking and you turn off the oven,
    what doesn\u2019t hurt is leaving the oven door open to let residual heat escape.\r\n\r\nHow
    to dress for the cold\r\nCozying up underneath layers of clothing or blankets
    (or both) can help insulate you from the cold.\r\nCozying up underneath layers
    of clothing or blankets (or both) can help insulate you from the cold.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nLayer
    on the clothes. \u201CLayering is critical,\u201D Smith said. \u201CEven thin
    layers added together to increase one\u2019s ability to retain heat \u2026 focus
    on keeping the torso warm. Often an extra shirt or vest can warm your hands and
    feet more than an extra pair of socks or gloves.\u201D Inexpensive pairs of tights
    or long johns can be worn underneath clothes. However, be sure that layering
    doesn\u2019t make your clothing tight, he added, since that could reduce blood
    flow and thus your body\u2019s ability to get warm blood to those areas. Wearing
    a hat, too, can also keep the heat in.\r\n\r\nWear thick socks and slippers.
    Fuzzy socks, slippers or a pair of shoes you reserve for wearing around the house
    can add extra comfort.\r\n\r\nPile on the blankets. \u201CThe more layers you
    put on, the better it helps trap the air between you,\u201D your sheets and your
    blankets, Benjamin said. Since you lose a lot of heat from your head while you\u2019re
    under blankets, he added, wearing a skull cap can help also.\r\n\r\ntightslead\r\nWinter
    tights that are equal parts stylish and cozy (Courtesy CNN Underscored)\r\nEmbrace
    less breathable clothing and linens. Breathable linens (such as the cotton-based
    variety) are often recommended during the summer, but linens with other materials
    and higher thread counts may be better for winter since higher thread counts
    have more weaving per square inch.\r\n\r\nOptimize your home and appliances\r\nThere
    are multiple ways to make your heating system work better, or to create your
    own warmth. \r\nThere are multiple ways to make your heating system work better,
    or to create your own warmth.\r\nShutterstock\r\nWork with the weather. Open
    your curtains or blinds to let the sun in during the day, or when outside is
    warmer than inside your home.\r\n\r\nSeal your windows and doors. Even if your
    windows and doors are totally shut and locked, drafts can seep in through small
    crevices. You can use caulk or shrink film to seal those cracks. Placing inexpensive,
    transparent shower curtains over windows can keep the sun in but the cold draft
    out. For the bottoms of doors, cloth draft stoppers are \u201Cvery effective,\u201D
    Benjamin said.\r\n\r\nClose off unoccupied rooms. By shutting the doors of rooms
    no one is using, you can create additional barriers between yourself and the
    cold outdoors. This can also aid preventing heat loss from the room you\u2019re
    in.\r\n\r\nReverse your ceiling fan. If possible, send your ceiling fan in a
    clockwise direction so that it sends the warm air down.\r\n\r\nSit near indoor
    heaters. You can safely use portable heaters if they are space heaters that have
    automatic shutoffs and can be plugged into a wall outlet instead of an extension
    cord. Since space heaters are a common cause of fires, they should be at least
    3 feet away from any drapes, bedding or furniture. To prevent high levels of
    carbon monoxide \u2014 which can cause potentially fatal poisoning \u2014 ensure
    you have a carbon monoxide monitor installed and that you don\u2019t \u201Cuse
    any type of outdoor gas heater or anything that is not electric,\u201D Benjamin
    said.\r\n\r\nMove anything that\u2019s blocking heat vents or radiators. The
    heat will better circulate throughout your home that way.\r\n\r\nSpend time and
    sleep in the upper levels of the house. Heat rises, so moving your working, sleeping
    and living spaces upward may be more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAfter showering, don\u2019t
    run the bathroom fan or close the door. Unless your bathroom is prone to growing
    humidity-induced mold, the warm steam from the shower can make the nearby air
    less dry and cool for a short period of time.\r\n\r\nBuy magnetic vent covers
    from home improvement stores. Used to cover vents, they can be inexpensive and
    help to force heat to exit vents in the occupied rooms only.\r\n\r\nPut down
    rugs or carpets. These can be warmer to the touch than bare floors.\r\n\r\n Insulate
    your attic. If you can afford to, padding your attic with insulation from hardware
    stores can help to retain some of the heat you usually lose through the attic
    since heat rises.\r\n\r\n Research what your residential area offers. Some locations
    may be running warming centers set up for safety during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nCozy
    up near the elements\r\nSitting near a fire is a method that's always reliable.
    \r\nSitting near a fire is a method that's always reliable.\r\nShutterstock\r\n
    Light a fire. If your fireplace runs on wood instead of gas, a fire is another
    way to keep a room warm and enjoy a cozy night. \u201CMake sure that your flue
    is properly opened and clean to make sure that smoke doesn\u2019t come back in
    the home but goes properly up the flue,\u201D Benjamin said. \u201CWhen the fire
    is out, you should of course close the flue because it\u2019s like having an
    open window.\u201D\r\n\r\n Keep warm and enjoy s\u2019mores. If your state, city,
    county or neighborhood allows, have a (moderate-size) backyard bonfire to keep
    warm for a while.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t light candles. Candles can emit a small amount
    of heat, but using them as a source of warmth can be dangerous. \u201CPeople
    will light candles and go to sleep, and they fall over,\u201D Benjamin said.
    \u201CThe cat comes in and kicks it over and starts a fire.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith
    these tips in mind and any others you find, be \u201Cbroadly thoughtful about
    how to stay warm in the winter,\u201D he added. \u201CIf it sounds like it\u2019s
    a bad idea, it probably is. Look it up and check it out before you do it.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis

  m_text: "<mark>CNNnews</mark>\nAs wintry weather whips across the United States,
    one challenge may be staying warm if you can\u2019t afford or are cutting back
    on indoor heating.\r\n\r\nStaying warm is necessary \u201Cfor a variety of health
    reasons\u201D in addition to comfort, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive
    director of the American Public Health Association. For people with arthritis,
    stiffness \u201Cin your back and neck and sore joints do occur more in colder
    weather. \u2026 People who have metabolic conditions can be sensitive to the
    weather, like diabetes, for example, and heart disease. The more cold you are,
    the more stress you put on your heart.\u201D\r\n\r\nA little savvy based on our
    warm-blooded bodies, food, appliances, furniture, the outdoor elements and more
    can go a long way. Here are 25 ways to stay warm this winter \u2014 with or without
    indoor heating \u2014 that won\u2019t break the bank.\r\n\r\nHow to warm your
    body\r\nPortable electric warmers are one way to temporarily keep parts of the
    body warm.\r\nPortable electric warmers are one way to temporarily keep parts
    of the body warm.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nWarm up with store-bought hand warmers,
    microwavable heating pads, hot water bottles or heated blankets. Following the
    manufacturer\u2019s instructions and concentrating on your torso are key, said
    JohnEric Smith, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology at Mississippi
    State University. \u201CIf you warm the core you can warm the hands and feet.
    It is harder to warm the core by warming the hands and feet.\u201D\r\n\r\nBe
    careful that you don\u2019t burn yourself, Benjamin said. \u201CThey\u2019re
    very effective on a knee or shoulder or the back of the neck. \u2026 You rarely
    put it directly on your skin. You usually wrap it in something, maybe a thin
    towel.\u201D\r\n\r\n Move your body. Physical activities like indoor exercise
    or dancing can help you warm up, but don\u2019t get to the point where you\u2019re
    sweating, Smith said. \u201CWe sweat to lose heat and sweating will make us colder.\u201D\r\n\r\nThink
    twice about taking a warm shower or bath. \u201CWhile a warm bath or shower will
    feel good for the minute,\u201D Smith said, \u201Cyou will be cold after you
    get out and your wet skin is losing heat more quickly.\u201D\r\n\r\nCuddle. Snuggles
    really can keep you warm. \u201CEach of us produces heat through our metabolic
    processes. We lose our heat to the environment as we maintain body temperature,\u201D
    Smith said via email. \u201CIncreasing skin contact decreases opportunities for
    the heat to be lost to the environment around us. If two people are under a blanket
    both of their heat losses combined can increase the temperature under the blanket
    more quickly than either could do independently.\u201D\r\n\r\nChange how you
    perceive cold. Some people have trained their minds to perceive cold as an objective,
    acceptable sensation rather than something dreadful to control. The best ways
    to adapt include wearing clothing in layers then removing it, or gradually lowering
    the thermostat and putting on a sweater, Benjamin said.\r\n\r\nWarmth that\u2019s
    comforting\r\nEnjoying warm foods and beverages is a two-in-one solution: You
    get heat from the appliances when you cook the food, then warmth when you eat
    it. \r\nEnjoying warm foods and beverages is a two-in-one solution: You get heat
    from the appliances when you cook the food, then warmth when you eat it.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nEnjoy
    warm beverages and foods, and use the oven and stove to cook them. Since foods
    higher in fat and protein are metabolized slowly by the body, those could make
    you feel warmer, Smith said. \u201CConsider hearty soups with beans and meat.\u201D
    Slow cooking meals can help generate heat throughout the day.\r\n\r\nDrinking
    warm beverages \u201Ccertainly helps take the chill off,\u201D Benjamin said.
    Leaving the oven or stove on is \u201Ca bad idea because it burns fuel,\u201D
    Benjamin said, \u201Cbut more importantly, people fall asleep, they forget and
    leave the stove on. Sometimes things on the stove can catch on fire. So like
    any tool, you should use it for the purpose in which it was designed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    only has to go poorly once to be life changing,\u201D Smith said. If you don\u2019t
    have children or pets, when you\u2019re done cooking and you turn off the oven,
    what doesn\u2019t hurt is leaving the oven door open to let residual heat escape.\r\n\r\nHow
    to dress for the cold\r\nCozying up underneath layers of clothing or blankets
    (or both) can help insulate you from the cold.\r\nCozying up underneath layers
    of clothing or blankets (or both) can help insulate you from the cold.\r\nShutterstock\r\n\r\nLayer
    on the clothes. \u201CLayering is critical,\u201D Smith said. \u201CEven thin
    layers added together to increase one\u2019s ability to retain heat \u2026 focus
    on keeping the torso warm. Often an extra shirt or vest can warm your hands and
    feet more than an extra pair of socks or gloves.\u201D Inexpensive pairs of tights
    or long johns can be worn underneath clothes. However, be sure that layering
    doesn\u2019t make your clothing tight, he added, since that could reduce blood
    flow and thus your body\u2019s ability to get warm blood to those areas. Wearing
    a hat, too, can also keep the heat in.\r\n\r\nWear thick socks and slippers.
    Fuzzy socks, slippers or a pair of shoes you reserve for wearing around the house
    can add extra comfort.\r\n\r\nPile on the blankets. \u201CThe more layers you
    put on, the better it helps trap the air between you,\u201D your sheets and your
    blankets, Benjamin said. Since you lose a lot of heat from your head while you\u2019re
    under blankets, he added, wearing a skull cap can help also.\r\n\r\ntightslead\r\nWinter
    tights that are equal parts stylish and cozy (Courtesy CNN Underscored)\r\nEmbrace
    less breathable clothing and linens. Breathable linens (such as the cotton-based
    variety) are often recommended during the summer, but linens with other materials
    and higher thread counts may be better for winter since higher thread counts
    have more weaving per square inch.\r\n\r\nOptimize your home and appliances\r\nThere
    are multiple ways to make your heating system work better, or to create your
    own warmth. \r\nThere are multiple ways to make your heating system work better,
    or to create your own warmth.\r\nShutterstock\r\nWork with the weather. Open
    your curtains or blinds to let the sun in during the day, or when outside is
    warmer than inside your home.\r\n\r\nSeal your windows and doors. Even if your
    windows and doors are totally shut and locked, drafts can seep in through small
    crevices. You can use caulk or shrink film to seal those cracks. Placing inexpensive,
    transparent shower curtains over windows can keep the sun in but the cold draft
    out. For the bottoms of doors, cloth draft stoppers are \u201Cvery effective,\u201D
    Benjamin said.\r\n\r\nClose off unoccupied rooms. By shutting the doors of rooms
    no one is using, you can create additional barriers between yourself and the
    cold outdoors. This can also aid preventing heat loss from the room you\u2019re
    in.\r\n\r\nReverse your ceiling fan. If possible, send your ceiling fan in a
    clockwise direction so that it sends the warm air down.\r\n\r\nSit near indoor
    heaters. You can safely use portable heaters if they are space heaters that have
    automatic shutoffs and can be plugged into a wall outlet instead of an extension
    cord. Since space heaters are a common cause of fires, they should be at least
    3 feet away from any drapes, bedding or furniture. To prevent high levels of
    carbon monoxide \u2014 which can cause potentially fatal poisoning \u2014 ensure
    you have a carbon monoxide monitor installed and that you don\u2019t \u201Cuse
    any type of outdoor gas heater or anything that is not electric,\u201D Benjamin
    said.\r\n\r\nMove anything that\u2019s blocking heat vents or radiators. The
    heat will better circulate throughout your home that way.\r\n\r\nSpend time and
    sleep in the upper levels of the house. Heat rises, so moving your working, sleeping
    and living spaces upward may be more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAfter showering, don\u2019t
    run the bathroom fan or close the door. Unless your bathroom is prone to growing
    humidity-induced mold, the warm steam from the shower can make the nearby air
    less dry and cool for a short period of time.\r\n\r\nBuy magnetic vent covers
    from home improvement stores. Used to cover vents, they can be inexpensive and
    help to force heat to exit vents in the occupied rooms only.\r\n\r\nPut down
    rugs or carpets. These can be warmer to the touch than bare floors.\r\n\r\n Insulate
    your attic. If you can afford to, padding your attic with insulation from hardware
    stores can help to retain some of the heat you usually lose through the attic
    since heat rises.\r\n\r\n Research what your residential area offers. Some locations
    may be running warming centers set up for safety during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nCozy
    up near the elements\r\nSitting near a fire is a method that's always reliable.
    \r\nSitting near a fire is a method that's always reliable.\r\nShutterstock\r\n
    Light a fire. If your fireplace runs on wood instead of gas, a fire is another
    way to keep a room warm and enjoy a cozy night. \u201CMake sure that your flue
    is properly opened and clean to make sure that smoke doesn\u2019t come back in
    the home but goes properly up the flue,\u201D Benjamin said. \u201CWhen the fire
    is out, you should of course close the flue because it\u2019s like having an
    open window.\u201D\r\n\r\n Keep warm and enjoy s\u2019mores. If your state, city,
    county or neighborhood allows, have a (moderate-size) backyard bonfire to keep
    warm for a while.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t light candles. Candles can emit a small amount
    of heat, but using them as a source of warmth can be dangerous. \u201CPeople
    will light candles and go to sleep, and they fall over,\u201D Benjamin said.
    \u201CThe cat comes in and kicks it over and starts a fire.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith
    these tips in mind and any others you find, be \u201Cbroadly thoughtful about
    how to stay warm in the winter,\u201D he added. \u201CIf it sounds like it\u2019s
    a bad idea, it probably is. Look it up and check it out before you do it.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis
